🌿 Hi, I am Nada, a full stack developer 👩‍💻. I embarked on the programming's shipboard Last year, after unexpected and eclectic circumstances due to my unstoppable question: How stuff works?
This question led me to develop an insatiable appetite for learning new things, exploring, and analyzing! 

🌿 Machines have been, since ever, my favorites playthings; I was very good at disassembling, not at assembling! Mechanics wasn't, obviously, my calling but understanding the functionalities and the logic behind was my super skill 💪

🌿 To describe the human body, [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes) compared it to a machine. As a machine's huge lover, I decided to uncover its mystery. It was a long path littered with adventures labeled : 👩‍⚕️ that docked my life's boat at the following port: the code's land 💻

🌿 My code journey started at the age of 14, hibernated for more than a decade, has been reborn in 2019 at a tech school where I got my bachelor's level diploma as a full stack developer. It has been continuing as a self-taught developer cause we all agree: There is a bunch of new things to learn every day! Honestly, who can stop learning ⁉️

⌚ My favorite programming moments : Solving intricate problems.

📜 My programming's philosophy: Fundamentals are the timeless trend 😉

🔎 I’m currently looking for a software developer full-time position
